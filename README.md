# Mob AI

Smalltalk with Mobs

**Important: ** This plugin is just a CLIENT. All questions are handled by our REST API (server side). <br>
It is based on NullDev's AIKIN AI. See here: <br>
https://github.com/NLDev/Telegram-AI

That means you will need your own endpoint to use this plugin. 

## What does it do? 

It enables you to speak to mobs. By simply entering 

`/mob YOUR TEXT`

All mobs in a specific range will reply to you!
